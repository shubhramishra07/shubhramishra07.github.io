üëãüèº Hi there, I'm Shubhra!

üîé I'm a senior at Stanford studying Computer Science (AI track) and Math. My main research focus is improving **math and code reasoning skills** in AI models using neurosymbolic techniques. I do research at [Stanford's Computation and Cognition Lab](https://cocolab.stanford.edu) and [Stanford's Autonomous Agents Lab](https://www.autonomousagents.stanford.edu) advised by Dr. Noah Goodman and Dr. Nick Haber.
